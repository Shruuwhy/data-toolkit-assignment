        "1. What is NumPy, and why is it widely used in Python?**  \n",
        "  ==> NumPy is a library for numerical computing in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on them. It is widely used because of its efficiency, ease of use, and powerful capabilities for scientific computing, including vectorized operations and broadcasting.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How does broadcasting work in NumPy?**  \n",
        "  ==> Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform element-wise operations on arrays of different shapes by automatically expanding the smaller array to match the larger one. This avoids the need for explicit looping, improving performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the differences between NumPy arrays and Python lists?**  \n",
        "==>\n",
        "- **Performance:** NumPy arrays are faster and consume less memory.  \n",
        "- **Functionality:** They support mathematical operations directly, unlike lists.  \n",
        "- **Fixed Size:** NumPy arrays have a fixed size, while lists are dynamic.  \n",
        "- **Homogeneous Elements:** NumPy arrays store elements of the same type, whereas lists can hold mixed types.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. How does NumPy handle multidimensional arrays?\n",
        "   ==> NumPy provides the `ndarray` object, which supports multi-dimensional arrays with efficient indexing, slicing, reshaping, and broadcasting. Functions like `reshape()`, `transpose()`, and `axis` operations make handling these arrays easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are some advanced features of NumPy?\n",
        "==> Some advanced features include:  \n",
        "- **Vectorized operations** for fast computations  \n",
        "- **Broadcasting** for handling different-sized arrays  \n",
        "- **Masked arrays** for missing data handling  \n",
        "- **Linear algebra functions** (`numpy.linalg`)  \n",
        "- **Random sampling** (`numpy.random`)  \n",
        "- **FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)** for signal processing  \n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Explain the use of the `groupby()` method in Pandas.\n",
        "==> `groupby()` is used to group data based on a specific column and apply functions like sum, mean, count, etc., to each group. It is useful for summarizing large datasets.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the significance of hierarchical indexing in Pandas?\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the purpose of the `describe()` function in Pandas?\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Why is handling missing data important in Pandas?\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. Explain the difference between `apply()` and `map()` in Pandas.\n",
        "==>\n",
        "- `apply()`: Used for applying a function to an entire row or column in a DataFrame.  \n",
        "- `map()`: Used for element-wise transformations in a Series.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does Pandas simplify time series analysis?  \n",
        "==> Pandas provides built-in date-time functions, resampling, frequency conversion, time zone handling, and rolling-window operations, making time series analysis easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the role of a pivot table in Pandas?  \n",
        "==> Pivot tables summarize data by aggregating values based on specified columns, similar to Excel pivot tables.  \n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is Seaborn preferred for statistical visualizations?\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is a heatmap, and when should it be used?\n",
        "==> A heatmap is a graphical representation of data using colors to indicate values. It is used for correlation matrices, confusion matrices, and visualizing large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the role of Seaborn’s `pairplot()` function?\n",
